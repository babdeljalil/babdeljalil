# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample MDX blog post that demonstrates how you can write content using MDX format. MDX allows you to use JSX components directly in your markdown content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components in your blog posts.

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Features

- **Markdown syntax** - All standard markdown features work
- **JSX components** - Use React components in your content
- **Code highlighting** - Beautiful syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **Custom styling** - Full control over the appearance

This is just a sample post to show how the blog system works. You can replace this with your own content!
